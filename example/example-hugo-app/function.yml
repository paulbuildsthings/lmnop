# requests are what the function is guaranteed to get. if a function requests a
# resource then it will only run if it can be given that resource. these are
# the defaults if nothing is specified by the configuration.
requests:
  cpu: 50m
  memory: 32Mi

# limits are what a function should never go above. a function just won't be
# able to schedule more CPU than this. if the function uses more memory than
# this it will be killed and restarted. these are the defaults if nothing is
# specified by the configuration.

  cpu: 100m
