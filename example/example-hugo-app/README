You can use this template to deploy a static site using the Hugo static site
build system. To deploy a Hugo-based static site:

* The "function.yml" file is used to tell the build system about the your
  app's configuration. It is required and must exist.
* Your app must have a directory called "site". This directory should contain
  a valid Hugo site and will be used to build the static site that is deployed.
  This directory is required and must exist.

To deploy this example to the demo, run these commands:

    git init
    git checkout -b main
    git add .
    git commit -m "initial commit"
    git remote add lmnop http://localhost:8000/scm/example
    git push lmnop main  # username: test, password: test
