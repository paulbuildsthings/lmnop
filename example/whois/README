Here's what happens:

When the "faas up" command happens it takes the template based on the language name and then copies the actual app into a subdir in the template called "function" so if we want to get things from the user's function from within the Dockerfil we have to refer to it as "function/whatever.txt" (or whatever the filename is).

For python applicaitons we're going to only copy "requirements.txt" out of the function root and then copy the entire "function" directory out of the function root. Then:

* The requirements.txt file gets copied and installed. It must exist or the whole thing will faile.
* The function must have a directory called "function". It will be copied to /home/app/function and the container will start from there, using WORKDIR.
* You must set a build_arg called "fprocess" which will be used to set the process that will start when the container starts.
