# this must match a template name. REQUIRED. (everything else is optional.)
template: python3.10

# requests are what the function is guaranteed to get. if a function requests a
# resource then it will only run if it can be given that resource. these are
# the defaults if nothing is specified by the configuration.
requests:
  cpu: 50m
  memory: 32Mi

# limits are what a function should never go above. a function just won't be
# able to schedule more CPU than this. if the function uses more memory than
# this it will be killed and restarted. these are the defaults if nothing is
# specified by the configuration.
limits:
  cpu: 100m
  memory: 64Mi

# these are environment variables. they aren't necessary but can be useful. do
# NOT put secret data into environment variables.
environment:
  foo: bar

# these secrets must exist or the function will never start. secrets can be
# created using the lmnop portal. they can be found in /var/openfaas/secrets
# where you will see a file with the same name as the secret and the contents
# of the file will be the actual secret data.
#secrets:
#  - secret-key

# options are specific to templates. the most common "option" is a string that
# contains a list of packages (i.e. libraries) to install. for example, you may
# need to have "git" installed or "curl" installed or whatever because the
# python libraries that you're using depend on these libraries in order to
# correctly install themselves.
options:
  packages: curl
