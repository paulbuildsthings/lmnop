To deploy a Python function:

* The "function.yml" file is used to tell the build system about the your
  app's configuration. It is required and must exist.
* The "entrypoint" file gets copied and installed to "/entrypoint". This file
  tells the system how to run our application. It is required and must exist.
* Your app must have a directory called "function". This directory is copied to
  "/home/lmnop/function" and the container will start in this directory. This
  directory is required and must exist.
* There is an optional file called "requirements.txt" that can contain Python
  library requirements that will be installed with pip when the container is
  built. It is optional.
* There is an optional file called "initialize" that gets copied and installed
  to "/initialize". This file is run as the lmnop user when the container is
  built to initialize any other settings required to be in the container. It is
  optional.

To deploy this example to the demo, run these commands:

    git init
    git checkout -b main
    git add .
    git commit -m "initial commit"
    git remote add lmnop http://localhost:8000/scm/example
    git push lmnop main  # username: test, password: test
